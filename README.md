## Features
This platform allows users to:
- Create an account and log in to access the reservation features.
- Reserve various spaces such as **Bureau**, **Salle de reunion**, **Salle de formation**, **Réception**, and **Espace calme**.
- After clicking "Réserver," users are redirected to a detailed page for the specific space (identified by its ID). 
- On the detailed page, users can reserve by clicking on an available chair.
- View their entire reservation history by clicking on "Historique" in the navigation bar.

For administrators:
- After logging in, they are redirected to the **Dashboard**.
- In the sidebar, they can access the list of users with all their details.
- Manage reservations by either accepting or canceling them.

This project aims to simplify the management and reservation of coworking spaces, providing an intuitive interface for both users and administrators.

## Folder Structure

The project includes a well-organized folder structure. One of the key folders is the **UI Interface**, which contains all components and styles used for the frontend design.
### UI Interface Folder
The **UI Interface** folder includes:
- **Components**: Reusable React components such as buttons, forms, and modals,.
- **Pages**: Specific pages like login, home, espace details, register , reservation and history.
- **Public**: Custom styles and Tailwind CSS configurations to ensure a consistent design.
- **Assets**: Images, icons, and other static files used across the UI.
- **hooks** :folder contains custom React hooks for managing reusable logic, such as state management, API calls, or side effects, to keep components clean and organized.
- **validation** :folder is designed for handling form validation using **Zod**. It includes schemas and utilities to ensure that user input is validated consistently across the application.
- **utils** :folder includes helper functions and utilities that are used throughout the project. Examples might include date formatters, API wrappers, or reusable logic for calculations.
### Admin Folder
The **admin** folder is dedicated to the admin panel and includes:
- **Components**: 
  - `AppSidebar`: The sidebar navigation for the admin panel.
  - `DataTable`: A table component used to display data like users, bookings, and rooms.
- **Pages**: 
  - `BookingList`: Displays all user bookings for the admin to manage.
  - `Columns`: Manages column definitions for tables in the admin panel.
  - `ColumnHistory`: Shows the history of changes or bookings.
  - `Dashboard`: The main dashboard providing an overview of admin-specific metrics and information.
  - `RoomList`: Displays and manages a list of rooms available for booking.
  - `UserList`: Displays and manages user information.

This structure ensures a clean separation of concerns, making the codebase easy to navigate and extend.
